<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

FreshGo aims to give farmers more control over their products, both in terms of sale as well as growth of their crops. 
This ultimately reduces costs for both customers and consumers by cutting out the middle-man and provides more job opportunities for would-be delivery staff.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
### Configuring Backend
Make sure you have a clean environment with no other containers as it can possibly conflict with this projectâ€™s ports mapping, image or container naming/labeling. 
Make sure that the Kong container and image is also deleted along with its network to set up a new kong configuration.
1. From the directory ./ESD-G1T1, open the terminal and enter `docker compose up`
2. Access [http://localhost:1337](http://localhost:1337) in a browser to create an admin user for Konga

```
Username: admin
Email:    <your email address>
Password: adminadmin
```
3. Sign in to continue
4. Connect Konga to Kong by creating a new connection

```
Name: default
Kong Admin URL: http://kong:8001
```
5. Go to Snapshots located on bottom right of the sidebar
6. Select IMPORT FROM FILE and import ./tools/kongSnapshot.json
7. Click on DETAILS for the new snapshot created
8. Select RESTORE, tick all of the boxes, and click on IMPORT OBJECTS


### Prerequisites

- Docker - 23.10.2
- Node - 16.13.0

Ensure you are running the same version by running the packages with `--version` in the terminal


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

1. Open folder in vscode and open terminal
2. Install required dependencies

```sh
	$ cd client
	$ npm install
```

3. Launch FreshGo Application

```sh
	$ npm run serve
```
4. Platform is only compatible for browser

## Scenario 1
Customer makes purchase from Farmer via our app

### Additional Points
1.Firebase is used as our API gateway for security implementations. Kong keeps the internal microservices frmo being directly exposed to external clients. 
2. To handle exceptions in business logic, Error handling is implemented if username or password is incorrect when logging in. User will be notified of the incorrect username or password

## Scenario 2
Farmers receive low-supply crop updates on demand to maintain adequate inventory

## Scenario 3
Farmers track crop growth

### Additional Points
1. Used machine learning microservice, more specifically the multiple regression model
